### AMF DEVICE

Bluetooth Bactria is an undergraduate biology laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, researching the extent to which temperature control can be used to aid in gene expression. 


The temperature is controlled through magnetic nanoparticles attached to a biological sample, which are heated and kept at a certain temperature. 


Myself and another student were recruited to build a device capable of emitting an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to heat and maintain the temperature of a biological sample.
